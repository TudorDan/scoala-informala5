## About The Repository

This is a readme file regarding the relevant details about the repository and its dependencies. The repository is partially made in Romanian Language.

The purpose of this repository is to implement the course lessons activity and individual practice from the _Web Development(Javacript) Program_ from  **The Informal School of IT** in Bucharest, that I started attending since December 5th, 2018.
